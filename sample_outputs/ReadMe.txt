In this folder, two naming conventions are used.

File names starting with breath, do actually contain breath segments
whereas other files are audio files with no breath segments.

In the files with breath segments, three types of files are given. They are

1) .phn files: phone level labels manually marked. In this files, labels with
'vocnoise' represent breath segments most of the time but sometimes may also 
correspond to other sounds like clearing of throat etc.

2) .txt files: These files are generated by the breath detection algorithm.
In thses files, segments labelled as 'breath' refer to regions detected as 
breath by the proposed algorithm and 'non breath' refer to segments detected
as non breath segments in the given audio file.

3) .wav file: This file is the audio file given as input to the algorithm for 
breath detection.

Note:
1) File names which do not start with breath are normal files with no breath
segments. They are used to show the working of the algorithm on normal audio
files with no breath segments.
2) Phone level labels for these files are not
available.
3) Only the labels generated by the algorithm are provided to show the performance 
of the algorithm.
